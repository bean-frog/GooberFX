# GooberFX
Theatre oriented sound effect application. Not amazing but it works (probably) <br>
supposedly lightweight but it uses electron so idk about that <br>
it runs on my cheap ass thinkpad though so it must be alright ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è <br>
written and tested on Linux, probably works on mac or windows because electron 
 ## to use:
 - probably not gonna build it because its annoying
 - so you have to run it from source
 - install npm and nodejs
 - download and unzip the code
 - go to the folder where it is
 - run npm install
 - run npm run start
 - uhhhhh enjoy the worst app ever created
 - put any files you want to use in the ./sounds folder btw
 - data.json stores the cues, you can edit it manually just make sure the formatting is correct
